# Efood Order Scraper

Hi! This is a small python script to give you an idea of how many orders you made and how much did you spent on [efood.gr](https://www.e-food.gr/).

Efood order scraper is based on selenium automation framework

It uses Python and its mission is to extract info about the orders in Efood

We can get the sum of all-time orders, money spent, year-month-hour frequency

You should enter your efood credentials at the appropriate lines, the code for gaccount login and facebook is incomplete so dont use it

For the setup, download the appropriate version of chrome webdriver into the same folder as the script and install selenium with ( pip install selenium )

You can run the script with chrome open, or headless by removing the comment from line 21
